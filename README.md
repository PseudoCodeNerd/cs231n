## CS231n Assignment Solutions

My completed assignments for [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition,](cs231n.stanford.edu) *Spring 2020*

Find course notes and assignments [here.](cs231n.stanford.edu) It was really nice of the fellas at CS231n to upload all the assignments and notes online for people like me to study and implement from. A huge thank you to all of them!
